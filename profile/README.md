# CloudNOOE Organization

Welcome to the CloudNOOE organization repository! This repository is dedicated to our Final Year Project (FYP) and encompasses all the code and resources we are developing. Our project leverages cutting-edge technologies to deliver innovative solutions in cloud infrastructure design and optimization.

---

## üåü Overview

Our FYP focuses on designing and developing an AI-powered cloud infrastructure design tool. By combining Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cloud engineering, we aim to simplify complex processes such as infrastructure design, optimization, live cost estimation, and seamless deployment. Our solution ensures scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness for businesses and developers alike.

CloudNOOE is more than a project; it‚Äôs a vision to transform the way cloud architectures are designed, making them smarter, faster, and more accessible to everyone. Whether you're an enterprise architect or an individual developer, CloudNOOE provides the tools you need to succeed in the cloud.
